    "1. **The `AASJobTable` Class**:\n",
    "    - This class is responsible for extracting and processing job listing tables from the AAS job register.\n",
    "    - Methods include:\n",
    "      - `__init__(self, link)`: Initialize with the job register link.\n",
    "      - `process_table(self, table)`: Process the HTML table to extract data and convert it into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "      - `retrieve_table(self)`: Retrieve the HTML table from the provided link.\n",
    "      - `filter_by_date(self, min_date, max_date, date_kw)`: Filter the DataFrame based on the provided date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filtering**:\n",
    "    - Define the number of days from today for the minimum and maximum deadline filters (`Nmin` and `Nmax`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow allows users to efficiently extract and filter job listings from the AAS job register based on specific application deadlines."
